# Indonesian OCR Example

This example demonstrates the new Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia) language support for OCR in DataMD.

## OCR with Indonesian Language
{{ image_ocr "scans/indonesian_document.jpg" "ind" }}

## Comparison with Default English OCR
{{ image_ocr "scans/indonesian_document.jpg" }}

Note: For this feature to work properly, you need to have the Indonesian language pack installed in Tesseract OCR.
